# Diabetes_Project
## Overview:
### This data set has 100,000 different data points. Each data point includes information about gender, age, whether the individual has hyptertension, diabetes, heart disease, smoking history, blood glucose levels,HbA1c levels, and bmi. The goal of this project is use analyze the data and try to find any correlations between the different columns. Such as hypternsion and diabetes. For this project used SQL and Tableau to create queries and visualizations. Using both these methods helped me come up with different queries that may help viewers better understand the data. Before creating any queries the first thing I did was make sure to clean the data by checking for null values and making sure the data made sense.Once this was done I started to create my queries.
